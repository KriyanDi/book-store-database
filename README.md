# Bookstore Database

**Bookstore Database** is a project that we made in **Sofia University - Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics** during the course **Database**. In short amount of time we manage to create small **IBM DB2 Database** with basic triggers, functions and views. We also managed to link our database with **Scriptcase** - a powerful tool that helps us visualize results from making queries to our database.
